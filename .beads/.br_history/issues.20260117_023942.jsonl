{"id":"beads_rust-1bi","title":"update Command Implementation","description":"# update Command\n\n## Purpose\nUpdate issue fields with strict validation, label operations, claim flow, and correct event/dirty behavior.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr update \u003cid...\u003e [OPTIONS]\nbr update [OPTIONS]  # Uses last-touched if no ID\n```\n\n## Core Flags\n\n### Field Updates\n- `--title \u003ctext\u003e`: Update title (1-500 chars).\n- `--description \u003ctext\u003e`: Update description (alias: `--body`).\n- `--design \u003ctext\u003e`: Update design notes.\n- `--acceptance \u003ctext\u003e`: Update acceptance criteria.\n- `--notes \u003ctext\u003e`: Update additional notes.\n\n### Workflow\n- `--status \u003cstatus\u003e`: Change status (open, in_progress, blocked, deferred, closed).\n- `--priority \u003c0-4|P0-P4\u003e`: Change priority.\n- `--type \u003ctype\u003e`: Change issue type.\n\n### Assignment\n- `--assignee \u003cname\u003e`: Assign to user (empty string clears).\n- `--owner \u003cname\u003e`: Set owner (empty string clears).\n- `--claim`: Atomic claim (assignee=actor + status=in_progress).\n\n### Scheduling\n- `--due \u003cdate\u003e`: Set due date (empty string clears).\n- `--defer \u003cdate\u003e`: Set defer-until date (empty string clears).\n- `--estimate \u003cminutes\u003e`: Set time estimate.\n\n### Labels\n- `--add-label \u003clabel\u003e`: Add label(s).\n- `--remove-label \u003clabel\u003e`: Remove label(s).\n- `--set-labels \u003clabels\u003e`: Replace all labels with these.\n\n### Relations\n- `--parent \u003cid\u003e`: Reparent to new parent (empty string removes parent).\n- `--external-ref \u003cref\u003e`: Set external reference.\n\n### Session\n- `--session \u003cid\u003e`: Set closed_by_session when closing.\n\n## Behavior\n1. **ID Resolution**: Accept multiple IDs. If none provided, use last-touched.\n2. **Change Detection**: Only apply flags that were explicitly provided.\n   - Important: P0 priority must detect flag-changed (not just value).\n3. **Claim Flow** (`--claim`):\n   - Set assignee to current actor.\n   - Set status to `in_progress`.\n   - Fails if already assigned to someone else.\n4. **Parent Reparenting** (`--parent`):\n   - Remove existing parent-child dependency.\n   - Add new parent-child dependency to new parent.\n   - Empty string removes parent without adding new one.\n5. **Label Operations**:\n   - `--add-label`: Append to existing labels.\n   - `--remove-label`: Remove from existing labels.\n   - `--set-labels`: Replace all labels entirely.\n6. **Field Clearing**: Empty string (`\"\"`) clears optional fields (due, defer, assignee, owner).\n7. **Content Hash**: Recompute content_hash on field changes.\n8. **Events**: Emit appropriate events (`field_changed`, `status_changed`, etc.).\n9. **Dirty Marking**: Mark issue as dirty for export.\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Updated title\",\n    \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n    \"priority\": 1,\n    \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Text Output\n```\nUpdated bd-abc12: Updated title\n  status: open → in_progress\n  priority: P2 → P1\n```\n\n### No Updates\n```\nNo updates specified for bd-abc12\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **IssueNotFound**: ID does not resolve → error.\n- **AmbiguousId**: ID resolves to multiple → error with candidates.\n- **AlreadyClaimed**: `--claim` on issue assigned to someone else → error.\n- **InvalidStatus**: Status not recognized → error with valid values.\n- **InvalidPriority**: Priority not in range → error.\n- **TitleTooLong**: Title exceeds 500 chars → error.\n- **ParentNotFound**: `--parent` ID does not exist → error.\n- **CycleDetected**: Reparenting would create cycle → error.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(ids = ?ids, \"Updating issues\");\ntracing::debug!(field = \"status\", old = %old, new = %new, \"Field changed\");\ntracing::info!(id = %id, assignee = %actor, \"Issue claimed\");\ntracing::debug!(id = %id, old_parent = ?old, new_parent = ?new, \"Reparenting issue\");\ntracing::warn!(id = %id, \"No changes applied\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Claim behavior matches bd.\n- Parent reparenting updates deps correctly.\n- JSON output matches bd.\n- Multiple IDs handled atomically.\n- Field clearing with empty string works.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

{"id":"beads_rust-25p","title":"sync Command Implementation","description":"# sync Command (flush-only / import-only)\n\n## Purpose\nProvide explicit JSONL sync actions **without** git operations. Only `--flush-only` and `--import-only` are supported in br v1. This command enables manual control over the SQLite ↔ JSONL synchronization.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr sync --flush-only [--force] [--manifest]\nbr sync --import-only [--force] [--orphans \u003cmode\u003e]\nbr sync --status\n```\n\n## Flags\n- `--flush-only`: Export DB → JSONL (uses export pipeline + auto-flush rules).\n- `--import-only`: Import JSONL → DB (uses import pipeline + staleness rules).\n- `--force`: Override safety checks (e.g., empty DB overwrite guard).\n- `--manifest`: Write `.manifest.json` with export results.\n- `--orphans \u003cmode\u003e`: Orphan handling mode for import (strict|resurrect|skip|allow).\n- `--status`: Show sync status (dirty count, last sync times, staleness).\n- `--json`: Output as JSON.\n- `--robot`: Machine-readable output.\n\n## Behavior\n\n### --flush-only (Export)\n1. Check for dirty issues in DB.\n2. If no dirty issues and no `--force`, report \"Nothing to export\" and exit.\n3. Execute export pipeline:\n   - Write issues to `issues.jsonl` (atomic write via temp file + rename).\n   - Write dependencies to `dependencies.jsonl`.\n   - Write comments to `comments.jsonl`.\n   - Write labels to `labels.jsonl`.\n4. Update metadata:\n   - Clear dirty flags for exported issues.\n   - Update `jsonl_content_hash` in metadata.json.\n   - Update `last_export_time`.\n5. Optionally write `.manifest.json` with export summary.\n\n### --import-only (Import)\n1. Check JSONL file modification times vs. last import time.\n2. If JSONL is not newer and no `--force`, report \"JSONL is current\" and exit.\n3. Execute import pipeline:\n   - Parse issues.jsonl with conflict marker detection.\n   - Run 4-phase collision detection.\n   - Apply collision resolution (timestamp-gated).\n   - Import in depth order (parents before children).\n   - Sync deps/labels/comments.\n4. Rebuild blocked cache.\n5. Update metadata:\n   - Update `last_import_time`.\n   - Update `jsonl_content_hash`.\n\n### --status\nReport sync status:\n```json\n{\n  \"dirty_count\": 5,\n  \"last_export_time\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"last_import_time\": \"2025-01-15T09:00:00Z\",\n  \"jsonl_newer\": false,\n  \"db_newer\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON (--flush-only)\n```json\n{\n  \"exported\": {\n    \"issues\": 42,\n    \"dependencies\": 15,\n    \"comments\": 23,\n    \"labels\": 8\n  },\n  \"cleared_dirty\": 5,\n  \"manifest_path\": \".beads/.manifest.json\"\n}\n```\n\n### JSON (--import-only)\n```json\n{\n  \"imported\": {\n    \"created\": 3,\n    \"updated\": 7,\n    \"skipped\": 2,\n    \"conflicts\": 0\n  },\n  \"blocked_cache_rebuilt\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Text Output (--flush-only)\n```\nExported 42 issues, 15 dependencies, 23 comments, 8 labels\nCleared dirty flag for 5 issues\n```\n\n### Text Output (--import-only)\n```\nImported from JSONL:\n  Created: 3 issues\n  Updated: 7 issues\n  Skipped: 2 issues (up-to-date)\n  Conflicts: 0\nRebuilt blocked cache\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **EmptyDbOverwrite**: Refuse to export empty DB over non-empty JSONL without `--force`.\n- **ConflictMarkers**: Abort import if `\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c` markers detected in JSONL.\n- **ParseError**: Report line number and content of invalid JSONL.\n- **PrefixMismatch**: Warn or error based on configuration.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\n// Export\ntracing::info!(\"Starting JSONL export\");\ntracing::debug!(dirty_count = %count, \"Found {} dirty issues\", count);\ntracing::info!(path = %path, \"Writing issues.jsonl\");\ntracing::debug!(issues = %n, deps = %d, \"Exported {} issues, {} dependencies\", n, d);\ntracing::info!(\"Export complete, cleared dirty flags\");\n\n// Import\ntracing::info!(\"Starting JSONL import\");\ntracing::debug!(path = %path, mtime = ?mtime, \"Checking JSONL staleness\");\ntracing::info!(\"JSONL is newer, importing\");\ntracing::debug!(phase = 1, \"Running collision detection\");\ntracing::info!(created = %c, updated = %u, skipped = %s, \"Import complete\");\ntracing::info!(\"Rebuilt blocked cache\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Uses same export/import code paths as explicit commands.\n- Honors `--no-auto-flush` / `--no-auto-import` if set in config.\n- No git operations performed.\n- Metadata updated correctly after sync.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

{"id":"beads_rust-4w1","title":"ready Command Implementation","description":"# ready Command\n\n## Purpose\nShow issues ready to work on, using blocked cache + scheduling filters. This is the primary \"what should I work on next?\" query.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr ready [OPTIONS]\n```\n\n## Flags\n- `--limit \u003cN\u003e`: Maximum number of issues to return (default: 20, 0 = unlimited).\n- `--assignee [\u003cname\u003e]`: Filter by assignee. No value = current actor.\n- `--unassigned`: Show only unassigned issues.\n- `--label \u003clabel\u003e`: Filter by label (AND logic, can repeat).\n- `--label-any \u003clabel\u003e`: Filter by label (OR logic, can repeat).\n- `--type \u003ctype\u003e`: Filter by issue type (can repeat).\n- `--priority \u003cpriority\u003e`: Filter by priority (can repeat).\n- `--sort \u003cpolicy\u003e`: Sort policy: hybrid (default), priority, oldest.\n- `--include-deferred`: Include deferred issues.\n- `--json`: JSON output.\n- `--robot`: Machine-readable output (alias for --json).\n\n## Ready Definition (classic)\nAn issue is \"ready\" if ALL conditions are true:\n1. Status is `open` OR `in_progress`.\n2. NOT in `blocked_issues_cache`.\n3. `defer_until` is NULL or \u003c= now (unless `--include-deferred`).\n4. `pinned = 0` (not pinned).\n5. `ephemeral = 0` AND ID does not contain `-wisp-` (not ephemeral).\n\n## Sort Policies\n\n### `hybrid` (default)\n1. P0/P1 issues sorted by `created_at ASC` (oldest critical first).\n2. Then all other issues sorted by `created_at ASC` (oldest first).\n\n### `priority`\nSort by `priority ASC`, then `created_at ASC`.\n\n### `oldest`\nSort by `created_at ASC` only.\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Implement feature X\",\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"priority\": 1,\n    \"issue_type\": \"feature\",\n    \"assignee\": \"alice\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2025-01-10T09:00:00Z\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Text Output\n```\nReady to work (5 issues):\n\n1. [P0] bd-abc12  Critical bug fix            (alice)\n2. [P1] bd-def34  Implement login             (unassigned)\n3. [P2] bd-ghi56  Add documentation           (bob)\n```\n\n### Empty Result\n```\nNo issues ready to work on.\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **DatabaseNotInitialized**: beads not initialized → suggest `br init`.\n- **InvalidSortPolicy**: Unknown sort policy → error with valid options.\n- **InvalidPriority**: Invalid priority filter → error.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(\"Fetching ready issues\");\ntracing::debug!(filters = ?filters, \"Applied filters\");\ntracing::debug!(sort = %sort_policy, \"Sort policy\");\ntracing::info!(count = ready.len(), \"Found {} ready issues\", count);\nfor issue in \u0026ready[..5.min(ready.len())] {\n    tracing::trace!(id = %issue.id, priority = issue.priority, \"Ready issue\");\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Ready filters + sort policies match bd.\n- Excludes pinned/ephemeral by default.\n- Blocked cache consulted (not recalculated).\n- Defer filtering respects current time.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

{"id":"beads_rust-ap0","title":"create Command Implementation","description":"# create Command\n\n## Purpose\nCreate a new issue with classic bd flag semantics, validation, and dependency/label handling.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr create \u003ctitle\u003e [OPTIONS]\nbr create --title \u003ctitle\u003e [OPTIONS]\n```\n\n## Core Flags\n- `\u003ctitle\u003e`: Positional argument or `--title` (must match if both provided).\n- `--type \u003ctype\u003e`: Issue type (task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question). Default: task.\n- `--priority \u003c0-4|P0-P4\u003e`: Priority level. Default: 2 (medium).\n- `--description \u003ctext\u003e`: Issue description body.\n- `--body \u003ctext\u003e`: Alias for `--description`.\n- `--body-file \u003cpath\u003e`: Read description from file.\n- `--design \u003ctext\u003e`: Design notes section.\n- `--acceptance \u003ctext\u003e`: Acceptance criteria section.\n- `--notes \u003ctext\u003e`: Additional notes section.\n- `--assignee \u003cname\u003e`: Assign to user.\n- `--owner \u003cname\u003e`: Set owner.\n- `--estimate \u003cminutes\u003e`: Time estimate in minutes.\n- `--labels \u003clabel,...\u003e`: Comma-separated labels (can repeat flag).\n- `--deps \u003ctype:id|id\u003e`: Add dependencies (default type: `blocks`).\n- `--parent \u003cid\u003e`: Create as child of parent issue (creates parent-child dependency).\n- `--external-ref \u003cref\u003e`: External reference (e.g., JIRA-123).\n- `--due \u003cdate\u003e`: Due date (natural time parsing).\n- `--defer \u003cdate\u003e`: Defer until date (natural time parsing).\n- `--id \u003cid\u003e`: Explicit ID (prefix validated unless `--force`).\n- `--force`: Skip prefix validation for explicit ID.\n- `--silent`: Output ID only (no other messages).\n- `--dry-run`: Preview without creating.\n- `--json`: JSON output.\n\n## Behavior\n1. **Title validation**: Length 1-500 characters. Error if empty or too long.\n2. **Priority validation**: Must be 0-4 or P0-P4. Error if invalid.\n3. **Description requirement**: If `create.require-description` config is set, warn/error if missing.\n4. **Title prefix warning**: If title starts with \"test\", warn unless `--silent`.\n5. **ID generation**:\n   - If `--id` provided, validate prefix matches `issue_prefix` or `allowed_prefixes` (unless `--force`).\n   - Otherwise, generate base36 adaptive-length hash ID.\n6. **Dependencies**: Parse `--deps` values. Format: `type:id` or just `id` (default: `blocks`).\n   - Invalid dependency types: warn and skip.\n   - Validate target IDs exist (unless external).\n7. **Labels**: Add all specified labels after creation.\n8. **Parent handling**: If `--parent`, create `parent-child` dependency.\n9. **Dirty marking**: Mark issue as dirty for export.\n10. **Event emission**: Emit `created` event.\n11. **Last-touched**: Set this issue as last-touched.\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n  \"title\": \"Implement feature X\",\n  \"status\": \"open\",\n  \"priority\": 2,\n

(`--silent`)\n```\nbd-abc12\n```\n\n### Dry-Run Mode\n```\nWould create issue:\n  Title: Implement feature X\n  Type: feature\n  Priority: P2\n  Labels: backend, api\n  Dependencies: bd-xyz89 (blocks)\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **EmptyTitle**: Title is empty → error with message.\n- **TitleTooLong**: Title exceeds 500 chars → error with message.\n- **InvalidPriority**: Priority not in valid range → error with suggestion.\n- **InvalidType**: Issue type not recognized → error with valid types list.\n- **InvalidDependencyTarget**: Dependency target does not exist → warning (non-fatal).\n- **InvalidDependencyType**: Dependency type not recognized → warning with valid types.\n- **PrefixMismatch**: Explicit ID prefix does not match config → error (unless `--force`).\n- **IdCollision**: Explicit ID already exists → error.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(title = %title, \"Creating new issue\");\ntracing::debug!(priority = priority, issue_type = %issue_type, \"Issue parameters\");\ntracing::debug!(labels = ?labels, deps = ?deps, \"Relations to add\");\ntracing::info!(id = %id, \"Issue created successfully\");\ntracing::warn!(dep_id = %id, \"Dependency target not found, skipping\");\ntracing::warn!(dep_type = %dep_type, \"Unknown dependency type, using blocks\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Flag semantics and validation match bd.\n- Dependency parsing and warnings match classic behavior.\n- ID generation follows adaptive-length algorithm.\n- All relation types (labels, deps, parent) handled correctly.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage

{"id":"beads_rust-asx","title":"close Command Implementation","description":"# close Command\n\n## Purpose\nClose issues with blocked checks, close reason, and optional suggest-next output.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr close \u003cid...\u003e [--reason \u003ctext\u003e] [--force] [--suggest-next] [--session \u003cid\u003e]\n```\n\n## Flags\n- `\u003cid...\u003e`: One or more issue IDs (partial resolution supported). If none provided, uses last-touched.\n- `--reason \u003ctext\u003e`: Close reason stored in `close_reason` field.\n- `--force`: Close even if issue is blocked by open dependencies.\n- `--suggest-next`: After closing, return newly unblocked issues (single ID only).\n- `--session \u003cid\u003e`: Set `closed_by_session` field for session tracking.\n\n## Behavior\n1. Resolve issue ID(s) via partial matching (see ID Resolution spec).\n2. For each issue:\n   - Check if blocked (in `blocked_issues_cache`); refuse unless `--force`.\n   - Set `status=closed`, `closed_at=now()`.\n   - Set `close_reason` if `--reason` provided.\n   - Set `closed_by_session` if `--session` provided.\n   - Emit `closed` event to event log.\n   - Mark issue as dirty for export.\n3. Rebuild blocked cache (some issues may become unblocked).\n4. If `--suggest-next` (single ID only):\n   - Compute set of issues unblocked by this close.\n   - Return those in output.\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON (default)\nArray of closed Issue objects:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Implement feature\",\n    \"status\": \"closed\",\n    \"closed_at\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"close_reason\": \"Completed\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### JSON with --suggest-next\n```json\n{\n  \"closed\": [{\"id\": \"bd-abc12\", ...}],\n  \"unblocked\": [{\"id\": \"bd-def34\", ...}, {\"id\": \"bd-ghi56\", ...}]\n}\n```\n\n### Text Output\n```\n✓ Closed bd-abc12: Implement feature\n  Reason: Completed\n  Unblocked: bd-def34, bd-ghi56\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **IssueNotFound**: If ID doesnt resolve → error with suggestions.\n- **AmbiguousId**: If ID resolves to multiple → error with candidate list.\n- **IssueBlocked**: If blocked and no `--force` → error listing blockers.\n- **AlreadyClosed**: Warning (not error) if issue already closed.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(id = %issue.id, \"Closing issue\");\ntracing::debug!(blocked_by = ?blockers, \"Checking blocked status\");\ntracing::info!(id = %issue.id, reason = ?reason, \"Issue closed\");\ntracing::debug!(unblocked = ?unblocked_ids, \"Issues unblocked by close\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Blocked check enforced unless `--force`.\n- JSON output shapes match bd.\n- Multiple ID closure works atomically.\n- `--suggest-next` only works with single ID.\n- Close reason persisted correctly.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

{"id":"beads_rust-ja0","title":"blocked Command Implementation","description":"# blocked Command\n\n## Purpose\nList blocked issues using `blocked_issues_cache` and show blockers. This command provides visibility into issues that cannot be worked on until their dependencies are resolved.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr blocked [--limit N] [--verbose] [--type \u003ctype\u003e] [--priority \u003cpriority\u003e] [--label \u003clabel\u003e]\n```\n\n## Flags\n- `--limit N`: Maximum number of blocked issues to return (default: 50, 0 = unlimited).\n- `--verbose`: Include full blocker details in text output.\n- `--type \u003ctype\u003e`: Filter by issue type (bug, feature, task, epic, chore).\n- `--priority \u003cpriority\u003e`: Filter by priority (0-4 or P0-P4).\n- `--label \u003clabel\u003e`: Filter by label (can be repeated, uses AND logic).\n- `--json`: Output as JSON.\n- `--robot`: Machine-readable output.\n\n## Behavior\n1. Read blocked issues from `blocked_issues_cache` table (not recalculated on the fly).\n2. For each blocked issue, retrieve immediate blockers (issues with `blocks` dependency).\n3. Apply filters (type, priority, labels).\n4. Sort by priority (ascending), then by number of blockers (descending).\n5. Return up to `--limit` issues.\n\n## Data Model\n```rust\npub struct BlockedIssue {\n    pub issue: Issue,\n    pub blocked_by_count: usize,\n    pub blocked_by: Vec\u003cString\u003e,  // IDs of immediate blockers\n}\n```\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Implement feature\",\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"priority\": 1,\n    \"blocked_by_count\": 2,\n    \"blocked_by\": [\"bd-xyz89\", \"bd-def34\"]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Text Output (default)\n```\nBlocked Issues (3 total):\n\n1. [bd-abc12] P1 Implement feature\n   Blocked by: bd-xyz89, bd-def34 (2 issues)\n\n2. [bd-ghi56] P2 Add tests\n   Blocked by: bd-abc12 (1 issue)\n```\n\n### Text Output (--verbose)\n```\nBlocked Issues (3 total):\n\n1.

[bd-ghi56] P2 Add tests\n   Blocked by:\n     • bd-abc12: Implement feature [P1] [blocked]\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **DatabaseNotInitialized**: If beads not initialized → suggest `br init`.\n- **CacheInvalid**: If cache is stale, trigger rebuild transparently.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(\"Fetching blocked issues from cache\");\ntracing::debug!(count = blocked.len(), \"Found {} blocked issues\", count);\nfor issue in \u0026blocked {\n    tracing::trace!(\n        id = %issue.id,\n        blockers = ?issue.blocked_by,\n        \"Blocked issue: {} blocked by {:?}\",\n        issue.id,\n        issue.blocked_by\n    );\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Reads from cache; does not recompute on every call.\n- JSON shape matches bd.\n- Filters work correctly (type, priority, labels).\n- Verbose mode shows blocker details.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

Emit `dependency_removed` event.\n\n### dep list\n- `down`: Dependencies this issue has (what it waits on).\n- `up`: Dependents (what waits on this issue).\n- `both`: Both directions.\n- Filter by `--type` if specified.\n\n### dep tree\n1. Build dependency tree from root issue.\n2. Apply `--max-depth` limit (default: 10).\n3. Return **flat list** of `TreeNode` objects with depth and parent info.\n4. Order by depth, then priority, then ID.\n5. Mark truncated nodes if depth limit reached.\n6. External deps synthesize leaf nodes (down direction only).\n\n### dep cycles\n1. Run cycle detection on all blocking dependencies.\n2. Use DFS with path tracking.\n3. Return list of cycles (each cycle is list of issue IDs).\n\n## Output\n\n### dep add/remove - JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"issue_id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n  \"depends_on_id\": \"bd-xyz89\",\n  \"type\": \"blocks\",\n  \"action\": \"added\"\n}\n```\n\n### dep list - JSON\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"depends_on_id\": \"bd-xyz89\",\n    \"type\": \"blocks\",\n    \"title\": \"Database schema\",\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"priority\": 0\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### dep tree - JSON (flat TreeNode list)\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n

JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"cycles\": [\n    [\"bd-abc12\", \"bd-def34\", \"bd-ghi56\", \"bd-abc12\"]\n  ],\n  \"count\": 1\n}\n```\n\n### Text Output - dep tree\n```\nbd-abc12: Root issue [P1] [open]\n├── bd-xyz89: Database schema [P0] [in_progress]\n│   └── bd-qrs12: Table design [P1] [open]\n└── bd-def34: API design [P1] [blocked]\n    └── (truncated at depth 3)\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **IssueNotFound**: ID does not resolve → error.\n- **DependencyExists**: Adding duplicate → warning (idempotent).\n- **CycleDetected**: Adding would create cycle → error with cycle path.\n- **InvalidDependencyType**: Unknown type → warning, use `blocks`.\n- **SelfDependency**: Issue depends on itself → error.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(issue = %issue_id, depends_on = %depends_on_id, \"Adding dependency\");\ntracing::debug!(dep_type = %dep_type, \"Dependency type\");\ntracing::info!(issue = %issue_id, depends_on = %depends_on_id, \"Dependency added\");\ntracing::warn!(dep_type = %dep_type, \"Unknown dependency type, using blocks\");\ntracing::error!(cycle = ?path, \"Cycle detected\");\ntracing::debug!(tree_size = tree.len(), max_depth = depth, \"Built dependency tree\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Cycle prevention for blocking types only.\n- Dependency type validation with fallback.\n- Tree output matches bd (flat list semantics, truncated flag).\n- External dep handling (`external:*`).\n- Blocked cache updated on add/remove.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//
