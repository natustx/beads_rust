{"id":"beads_rust-25p","title":"sync Command Implementation","description":"# sync Command (flush-only / import-only)\n\n## Purpose\nProvide explicit JSONL sync actions **without** git operations. Only `--flush-only` and `--import-only` are supported in br v1. This command enables manual control over the SQLite ↔ JSONL synchronization.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr sync --flush-only [--force] [--manifest]\nbr sync --import-only [--force] [--orphans \u003cmode\u003e]\nbr sync --status\n```\n\n## Flags\n- `--flush-only`: Export DB → JSONL (uses export pipeline + auto-flush rules).\n- `--import-only`: Import JSONL → DB (uses import pipeline + staleness rules).\n- `--force`: Override safety checks (e.g., empty DB overwrite guard).\n- `--manifest`: Write `.manifest.json` with export results.\n- `--orphans \u003cmode\u003e`: Orphan handling mode for import (strict|resurrect|skip|allow).\n- `--status`: Show sync status (dirty count, last sync times, staleness).\n- `--json`: Output as JSON.\n- `--robot`: Machine-readable output.\n\n## Behavior\n\n### --flush-only (Export)\n1. Check for dirty issues in DB.\n2. If no dirty issues and no `--force`, report \"Nothing to export\" and exit.\n3. Execute export pipeline:\n   - Write issues to `issues.jsonl` (atomic write via temp file + rename).\n   - Write dependencies to `dependencies.jsonl`.\n   - Write comments to `comments.jsonl`.\n   - Write labels to `labels.jsonl`.\n4. Update metadata:\n   - Clear dirty flags for exported issues.\n   - Update `jsonl_content_hash` in metadata.json.\n   - Update `last_export_time`.\n5. Optionally write `.manifest.json` with export summary.\n\n### --import-only (Import)\n1. Check JSONL file modification times vs. last import time.\n2. If JSONL is not newer and no `--force`, report \"JSONL is current\" and exit.\n3. Execute import pipeline:\n   - Parse issues.jsonl with conflict marker detection.\n   - Run 4-phase collision detection.\n   - Apply collision resolution (timestamp-gated).\n   - Import in depth order (parents before children).\n   - Sync deps/labels/comments.\n4. Rebuild blocked cache.\n5. Update metadata:\n   - Update `last_import_time`.\n   - Update `jsonl_content_hash`.\n\n### --status\nReport sync status:\n```json\n{\n  \"dirty_count\": 5,\n  \"last_export_time\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"last_import_time\": \"2025-01-15T09:00:00Z\",\n  \"jsonl_newer\": false,\n  \"db_newer\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON (--flush-only)\n```json\n{\n  \"exported\": {\n    \"issues\": 42,\n    \"dependencies\": 15,\n    \"comments\": 23,\n    \"labels\": 8\n  },\n  \"cleared_dirty\": 5,\n  \"manifest_path\": \".beads/.manifest.json\"\n}\n```\n\n### JSON (--import-only)\n```json\n{\n  \"imported\": {\n    \"created\": 3,\n    \"updated\": 7,\n    \"skipped\": 2,\n    \"conflicts\": 0\n  },\n  \"blocked_cache_rebuilt\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Text Output (--flush-only)\n```\nExported 42 issues, 15 dependencies, 23 comments, 8 labels\nCleared dirty flag for 5 issues\n```\n\n### Text Output (--import-only)\n```\nImported from JSONL:\n  Created: 3 issues\n  Updated: 7 issues\n  Skipped: 2 issues (up-to-date)\n  Conflicts: 0\nRebuilt blocked cache\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **EmptyDbOverwrite**: Refuse to export empty DB over non-empty JSONL without `--force`.\n- **ConflictMarkers**: Abort import if `\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c` markers detected in JSONL.\n- **ParseError**: Report line number and content of invalid JSONL.\n- **PrefixMismatch**: Warn or error based on configuration.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\n// Export\ntracing::info!(\"Starting JSONL export\");\ntracing::debug!(dirty_count = %count, \"Found {} dirty issues\", count);\ntracing::info!(path = %path, \"Writing issues.jsonl\");\ntracing::debug!(issues = %n, deps = %d, \"Exported {} issues, {} dependencies\", n, d);\ntracing::info!(\"Export complete, cleared dirty flags\");\n\n// Import\ntracing::info!(\"Starting JSONL import\");\ntracing::debug!(path = %path, mtime = ?mtime, \"Checking JSONL staleness\");\ntracing::info!(\"JSONL is newer, importing\");\ntracing::debug!(phase = 1, \"Running collision detection\");\ntracing::info!(created = %c, updated = %u, skipped = %s, \"Import complete\");\ntracing::info!(\"Rebuilt blocked cache\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Uses same export/import code paths as explicit commands.\n- Honors `--no-auto-flush` / `--no-auto-import` if set in config.\n- No git operations performed.\n- Metadata updated correctly after sync.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

{"id":"beads_rust-4w1","title":"ready Command Implementation","description":"# ready Command\n\n## Purpose\nShow issues ready to work on, using blocked cache + scheduling filters. This is the primary \"what should I work on next?\" query.\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr ready [OPTIONS]\n```\n\n## Flags\n- `--limit \u003cN\u003e`: Maximum number of issues to return (default: 20, 0 = unlimited).\n- `--assignee [\u003cname\u003e]`: Filter by assignee. No value = current actor.\n- `--unassigned`: Show only unassigned issues.\n- `--label \u003clabel\u003e`: Filter by label (AND logic, can repeat).\n- `--label-any \u003clabel\u003e`: Filter by label (OR logic, can repeat).\n- `--type \u003ctype\u003e`: Filter by issue type (can repeat).\n- `--priority \u003cpriority\u003e`: Filter by priority (can repeat).\n- `--sort \u003cpolicy\u003e`: Sort policy: hybrid (default), priority, oldest.\n- `--include-deferred`: Include deferred issues.\n- `--json`: JSON output.\n- `--robot`: Machine-readable output (alias for --json).\n\n## Ready Definition (classic)\nAn issue is \"ready\" if ALL conditions are true:\n1. Status is `open` OR `in_progress`.\n2. NOT in `blocked_issues_cache`.\n3. `defer_until` is NULL or \u003c= now (unless `--include-deferred`).\n4. `pinned = 0` (not pinned).\n5. `ephemeral = 0` AND ID does not contain `-wisp-` (not ephemeral).\n\n## Sort Policies\n\n### `hybrid` (default)\n1. P0/P1 issues sorted by `created_at ASC` (oldest critical first).\n2. Then all other issues sorted by `created_at ASC` (oldest first).\n\n### `priority`\nSort by `priority ASC`, then `created_at ASC`.\n\n### `oldest`\nSort by `created_at ASC` only.\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Implement feature X\",\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"priority\": 1,\n    \"issue_type\": \"feature\",\n    \"assignee\": \"alice\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2025-01-10T09:00:00Z\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Text Output\n```\nReady to work (5 issues):\n\n1. [P0] bd-abc12  Critical bug fix            (alice)\n2. [P1] bd-def34  Implement login             (unassigned)\n3. [P2] bd-ghi56  Add documentation           (bob)\n```\n\n### Empty Result\n```\nNo issues ready to work on.\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **DatabaseNotInitialized**: beads not initialized → suggest `br init`.\n- **InvalidSortPolicy**: Unknown sort policy → error with valid options.\n- **InvalidPriority**: Invalid priority filter → error.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(\"Fetching ready issues\");\ntracing::debug!(filters = ?filters, \"Applied filters\");\ntracing::debug!(sort = %sort_policy, \"Sort policy\");\ntracing::info!(count = ready.len(), \"Found {} ready issues\", count);\nfor issue in \u0026ready[..5.min(ready.len())] {\n    tracing::trace!(id = %issue.id, priority = issue.priority, \"Ready issue\");\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Ready filters + sort policies match bd.\n- Excludes pinned/ephemeral by default.\n- Blocked cache consulted (not recalculated).\n- Defer filtering respects current time.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

Parse JSONL with 2MB buffer.\n3. Normalize:\n   - Recompute content_hash (ignore JSONL value)\n   - If ID contains `-wisp-`, set `ephemeral=true`\n   - Apply defaults (`SetDefaults`) + closed_at invariant repair\n4. **Clear export_hashes** before import.\n5. Prefix validation (skip in multi-repo or `SkipPrefixValidation=true`).\n6. Collision detection (4-phase): external_ref → content_hash → ID → new.\n7. Tombstone protection: if DB has tombstone for ID, **skip** incoming.\n8. Orphan handling: `strict|resurrect|skip|allow`.\n9. Create issues depth-by-depth (parents first).\n10. Sync deps/labels/comments after issues.\n11. Refresh blocked cache.\n12.

Multi-Platform Installer Script\n- Platform detection (Linux/macOS/Windows, amd64/arm64)\n- Download from GitHub Releases with checksum verification\n- Fallback to source build if binary unavailable\n- Idempotent installation (safe to re-run)\n- Lock mechanism to prevent concurrent installs\n- Resume capability for interrupted downloads\n- PATH modification with shell detection\n\n### 2. Self-Update Command\n- `br update` - Check for and install updates\n- `br update --check` - Check only, don't install\n- `br update --force` - Force reinstall current version\n- Use `self_update` or `patchify` crate\n- Ed25519 signature verification\n- SHA256 hash verification of downloaded files\n- Streaming downloads for large files\n\n### 3. Release Automation\n- GitHub Actions workflow for multi-platform builds\n- Automatic checksum generation\n- Release asset naming convention\n- Changelog generation from closed issues\n\n### 4. Package Manager Distribution\n- Homebrew tap: `brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/br`\n- Scoop bucket for Windows users\n- AUR package for Arch Linux\n- crates.io publishing for Rust users\n\n### 5. Version Management\n- Semantic versioning (SemVer)\n- `br version` shows build info, git commit, build date\n- `br version --check` shows if update available\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Single-command installation on all supported platforms\n- `br update` successfully updates the binary in-place\n- All downloads verified with checksums\n- Installation is fully idempotent\n- Works behind corporate proxies (HTTPS_PROXY support)\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Installer Script Pattern\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.sh | bash\n# OR\ncurl -fsSL https://br.tools/install | bash\n```\n\n### Self-Update with self_update crate\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nself_update = { version = \"0.27\", features = [\"rustls\"], default-features = false }\n```\n\n### Release Profile (already in place)\n```toml\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = \"z\"     # Size optimization\nlto = true           # Link-time optimization\ncodegen-units = 1    # Single codegen unit\npanic = \"abort\"      # No unwinding\nstrip = true         # Remove symbols\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n- Ed25519 signatures for release files\n- SHA256 checksums in separate .sha256 files\n- HTTPS-only downloads (rustls, no OpenSSL)\n- Verify before replace (atomic update)\n\n## References\n- self_update crate: https://github.com/jaemk/self_update\n- patchify crate: https://github.com/danwilliams/patchify\n- trust project: CI release builds\n- ACFS manifest pattern for tool distribution\n\n## Dependencies\n- CI/CD Pipeline (beads_rust-na7)\n- version Command (beads_rust-k8p) - completed","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"SwiftGrove","estimated_minutes":0,"created_at":"2026-01-16T18:48:13.745544823Z","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-17T09:01:48.844047591-05:00"}

{"id":"beads_rust-9u2","title":"EPIC: Interactive TUI Mode with Ratatui","description":"# Interactive TUI Mode with Ratatui\n\n## Background \u0026 Rationale\n\nBased on research of mature TUI tools (beads_viewer with Bubbletea, cass with Ratatui) and 2025-2026 terminal UI best practices, br would benefit from an optional interactive TUI mode for users who prefer visual exploration over command-line invocations.\n\n### Why This Matters\n- beads_viewer (bv) provides TUI for Go beads but requires separate installation\n- Integrated TUI mode gives users choice without extra tools\n- TUI enables rapid exploration of issue graphs and dependencies\n- Visual feedback improves UX for complex operations\n- Follows the dual-mode pattern: TUI for humans, CLI for agents\n\n## Goals\nDeliver an optional TUI mode using Ratatui that allows users to browse, filter, and manage issues interactively while maintaining the CLI-first design philosophy.\n\n## In-Scope (v1 TUI)\n- `br tui` or `br -i` to launch interactive mode\n- Issue list view with filtering and sorting\n- Issue detail view with full content\n- Dependency graph visualization (ASCII art)\n- Keyboard navigation (vim-style bindings)\n- Search/filter as you type\n- Quick actions (close, update status, add comment)\n- Theme support (light/dark, custom colors)\n\n## Out-of-Scope (v1)\n- Full feature parity with bv\n- Graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness) - use bv for that\n- Real-time collaboration features\n- Mouse support (keyboard-first)\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Ratatui Stack\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nratatui = \"0.30\"\ncrossterm = \"0.28\"\ntui-textarea = \"0.7\"     # Text input\ntui-tree-widget = \"0.22\" # Tree views\n```\n\n### Architecture (Elm-inspired)\n```rust\nstruct App {\n    state: AppState,\n    issues: Vec\u003cIssue\u003e,\n    selected: Option\u003cusize\u003e,\n    filter: String,\n    mode: Mode,\n}\n\nenum Mode {\n    List,\n    Detail,\n    Search,\n    Action,\n}\n\nenum Message {\n    KeyPress(KeyEvent),\n    IssueSelected(String),\n    FilterChanged(String),\n    ActionCompleted(Result\u003c(), Error\u003e),\n}\n\nfn update(app: \u0026mut App, msg: Message) -\u003e Option\u003cCommand\u003e { ... }\nfn view(app: \u0026App) -\u003e impl Widget { ... }\n```\n\n### Styling with Ratatui\n```rust\nuse ratatui::style::{Color, Modifier, Style};\n\nlet priority_style = match issue.priority {\n    0 =\u003e Style::default().fg(Color::Red).add_modifier(Modifier::BOLD),\n    1 =\u003e Style::default().fg(Color::Yellow),\n    2 =\u003e Style::default().fg(Color::White),\n    _ =\u003e Style::default().fg(Color::DarkGray),\n};\n```\n\n### Feature Flag\n```toml\n[features]\ndefault = []\ntui = [\"ratatui\", \"crossterm\", \"tui-textarea\"]\n```\n\nBuild with TUI: `cargo build --features tui`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- `br tui` launches interactive mode\n- Issue list displays with priority colors\n- Keyboard navigation works smoothly\n- Filter/search is responsive\n- Quick actions update database correctly\n- Graceful exit restores terminal state\n- Works on Linux, macOS, Windows Terminal\n\n## Views\n\n### List View\n```\n┌─ br -

Default: 2 (medium).\n- `--description \u003ctext\u003e`: Issue description body.\n- `--body \u003ctext\u003e`: Alias for `--description`.\n- `--body-file \u003cpath\u003e`: Read description from file.\n- `--design \u003ctext\u003e`: Design notes section.\n- `--acceptance \u003ctext\u003e`: Acceptance criteria section.\n- `--notes \u003ctext\u003e`: Additional notes section.\n- `--assignee \u003cname\u003e`: Assign to user.\n- `--owner \u003cname\u003e`: Set owner.\n- `--estimate \u003cminutes\u003e`: Time estimate in minutes.\n- `--labels \u003clabel,...\u003e`: Comma-separated labels (can repeat flag).\n- `--deps \u003ctype:id|id\u003e`: Add dependencies (default type: `blocks`).\n- `--parent \u003cid\u003e`: Create as child of parent issue (creates parent-child dependency).\n- `--external-ref \u003cref\u003e`: External reference (e.g., JIRA-123).\n- `--due \u003cdate\u003e`: Due date (natural time parsing).\n- `--defer \u003cdate\u003e`: Defer until date (natural time parsing).\n- `--id \u003cid\u003e`: Explicit ID (prefix validated unless `--force`).\n- `--force`: Skip prefix validation for explicit ID.\n- `--silent`: Output ID only (no other messages).\n- `--dry-run`: Preview without creating.\n- `--json`: JSON output.\n\n## Behavior\n1. **Title validation**: Length 1-500 characters. Error if empty or too long.\n2. **Priority validation**: Must be 0-4 or P0-P4. Error if invalid.\n3. **Description requirement**: If `create.require-description` config is set, warn/error if missing.\n4. **Title prefix warning**: If title starts with \"test\", warn unless `--silent`.\n5. **ID generation**:\n   - If `--id` provided, validate prefix matches `issue_prefix` or `allowed_prefixes` (unless `--force`).\n   - Otherwise, generate base36 adaptive-length hash ID.\n6. **Dependencies**: Parse `--deps` values. Format: `type:id` or just `id` (default: `blocks`).\n   - Invalid dependency types: warn and skip.\n   - Validate target IDs exist (unless external).\n7. **Labels**: Add all specified labels after creation.\n8. **Parent handling**: If `--parent`, create `parent-child` dependency.\n9. **Dirty marking**: Mark issue as dirty for export.\n10. **Event emission**: Emit `created` event.\n11. **Last-touched**: Set this issue as last-touched.\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n  \"title\": \"Implement feature X\",\n  \"status\": \"open\",\n  \"priority\": 2,\n  \"issue_type\": \"feature\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-01-15T10:00:00Z\",\n  \"created_by\": \"alice\"\n}\n```\n\n### Text Output\n```\nCreated bd-abc12: Implement feature X\n```\n\n### Silent Mode (`--silent`)\n```\nbd-abc12\n```\n\n### Dry-Run Mode\n```\nWould create issue:\n  Title: Implement feature X\n  Type: feature\n  Priority: P2\n  Labels: backend, api\n  Dependencies: bd-xyz89 (blocks)\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **EmptyTitle**: Title is empty → error with message.\n- **TitleTooLong**: Title exceeds 500 chars → error with message.\n- **InvalidPriority**: Priority not in valid range → error with suggestion.\n- **InvalidType**: Issue type not recognized → error with valid types list.\n- **InvalidDependencyTarget**: Dependency target does not exist → warning (non-fatal).\n- **InvalidDependencyType**: Dependency type not recognized → warning with valid types.\n- **PrefixMismatch**: Explicit ID prefix does not match config → error (unless `--force`).\n- **IdCollision**: Explicit ID already exists → error.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(title = %title, \"Creating new issue\");\ntracing::debug!(priority = priority, issue_type = %issue_type, \"Issue parameters\");\ntracing::debug!(labels = ?labels, deps = ?deps, \"Relations to add\");\ntracing::info!(id = %id, \"Issue created successfully\");\ntracing::warn!(dep_id = %id, \"Dependency target not found, skipping\");\ntracing::warn!(dep_type = %dep_type, \"Unknown dependency type, using blocks\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Flag semantics and validation match bd.\n- Dependency parsing and warnings match classic behavior.\n- ID generation follows adaptive-length algorithm.\n- All relation types (labels, deps, parent) handled correctly.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage

For each issue:\n   - Check if blocked (in `blocked_issues_cache`); refuse unless `--force`.\n   - Set `status=closed`, `closed_at=now()`.\n   - Set `close_reason` if `--reason` provided.\n   - Set `closed_by_session` if `--session` provided.\n   - Emit `closed` event to event log.\n   - Mark issue as dirty for export.\n3. Rebuild blocked cache (some issues may become unblocked).\n4. If `--suggest-next` (single ID only):\n   - Compute set of issues unblocked by this close.\n   - Return those in output.\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON (default)\nArray of closed Issue objects:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Implement feature\",\n    \"status\": \"closed\",\n    \"closed_at\": \"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"close_reason\": \"Completed\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### JSON with --suggest-next\n```json\n{\n  \"closed\": [{\"id\": \"bd-abc12\", ...}],\n  \"unblocked\": [{\"id\": \"bd-def34\", ...}, {\"id\": \"bd-ghi56\", ...}]\n}\n```\n\n### Text Output\n```\n✓ Closed bd-abc12: Implement feature\n  Reason: Completed\n  Unblocked: bd-def34, bd-ghi56\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **IssueNotFound**: If ID doesnt resolve → error with suggestions.\n- **AmbiguousId**: If ID resolves to multiple → error with candidate list.\n- **IssueBlocked**: If blocked and no `--force` → error listing blockers.\n- **AlreadyClosed**: Warning (not error) if issue already closed.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(id = %issue.id, \"Closing issue\");\ntracing::debug!(blocked_by = ?blockers, \"Checking blocked status\");\ntracing::info!(id = %issue.id, reason = ?reason, \"Issue closed\");\ntracing::debug!(unblocked = ?unblocked_ids, \"Issues unblocked by close\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Blocked check enforced unless `--force`.\n- JSON output shapes match bd.\n- Multiple ID closure works atomically.\n- `--suggest-next` only works with single ID.\n- Close reason persisted correctly.\n\n## Unit

Use 'br list' to see all issues\",\n    \"retryable\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Robot Mode Detection\n- Explicit `--robot-*` flags take precedence\n- `--json` implies structured output\n- Check `isatty(stdout)` for auto-detection\n- Respect `NO_COLOR` and `TERM=dumb`\n\n## References\n- Anthropic: Claude Code Best Practices for Agentic Coding\n- beads_viewer: `--robot-triage`, `--robot-plan` implementation\n- cass: `--robot-help` pattern\n- Charm ecosystem: gum, lipgloss for styling\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase 3: Relations \u0026 Search (for graph analysis)\n- Colored Terminal Output (for human mode contrast)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","estimated_minutes":0,"created_at":"2026-01-16T18:47:49.786338482Z","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-16T18:54:35.306550245Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T18:54:35.306550245Z","close_reason":"ERROR: --robot-* flags are bv's domain, not br's. br is non-invasive CLI only.

500 char limit boundary\n8. `conformance_create_special_chars` - Quotes, backslashes, newlines in title\n9. `conformance_create_empty_title_error` - Should fail with clear error\n10. `conformance_create_invalid_priority_error` - Priority 5 or -1 should error\n\n### list (12 new tests)\n1. `conformance_list_filter_status_open` - --status=open\n2. `conformance_list_filter_status_closed` - --status=closed\n3. `conformance_list_filter_status_in_progress` -

Clear error messages help users fix issues quickly. Collecting all errors (rather than fail-fast) enables users to fix multiple problems in one attempt.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","estimated_minutes":0,"created_at":"2026-01-16T07:22:32.753559165Z","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-16T13:58:58.872070502Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T13:58:58.872070502Z","close_reason":"Implemented validation module + tests"}

{"id":"beads_rust-egz8","title":"Test Harness Foundation Enhancements","description":"# Test Harness Foundation Enhancements\n\n## Purpose\nBefore expanding conformance tests, the existing test harness needs significant enhancements to support:\n- **Comprehensive logging** with multiple levels and structured output\n- **More comparison modes** (array ordering tolerance, field exclusion)\n- **Better error diagnostics** (show detailed diff on failure with actionable suggestions)\n- **Benchmark timing infrastructure** (warmup, multiple runs, statistics)\n- **Shared test scenarios** that can be reused for benchmarks\n- **Test report generation** (JUnit XML, summary reports)\n\n## Current State\nThe existing `tests/conformance.rs` has:\n- `ConformanceWorkspace` struct for paired br/bd directories\n- `run_br()` and `run_bd()` methods with basic file logging\n- `CompareMode` enum with 4 modes\n- `normalize_json()` for timestamp/ID masking\n- Basic logging to files (timestamp, duration, stdout/stderr)\n\n## Required Enhancements\n\n### 1. Comprehensive Logging Infrastructure\n\n**Log Levels**:\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]\npub enum LogLevel {\n    Error = 0,   // Only failures and errors\n    Warn = 1,    // + warnings (e.g., slow tests)\n    Info = 2,    // + test progress, summaries\n    Debug = 3,   // + command details, timings\n    Trace = 4,   // + raw outputs, internal state\n}\n```\n\n**Structured Log Format**:\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]\npub struct LogEntry {\n    pub timestamp: DateTime\u003cUtc\u003e,\n    pub level: LogLevel,\n    pub test_name: String,\n    pub phase: TestPhase,  // Setup, Execute, Compare, Teardown\n    pub message: String,\n    pub context: Option\u003cserde_json::Value\u003e,\n    pub duration_ms: Option\u003cu64\u003e,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]\npub enum TestPhase {\n    Setup,\n    ExecuteBr,\n    ExecuteBd,\n    Compare,\n    Teardown,\n}\n```\n\n**Log Destinations**:\n```rust\npub struct LogConfig {\n    pub console_level: LogLevel,      // What to print to stderr\n    pub file_level: LogLevel,         // What to write to log files\n    pub structured_json: bool,        // JSON vs human-readable\n    pub log_dir: PathBuf,\n    pub aggregate_log: PathBuf,       // Single file with all tests\n    pub per_test_logs: bool,          // Individual log per test\n}\n```\n\n**Usage in tests**:\n```rust\nfn conformance_create_basic() {\n    let logger = TestLogger::new(\"conformance_create_basic\");\n    \n    logger.info(\"Setting up workspace\");\n    let workspace = ConformanceWorkspace::new();\n    \n    logger.debug(\"Initializing both workspaces\");\n    workspace.init_both();\n    \n    logger.info(\"Executing br create\");\n    let br_result = workspace.run_br([\"create\", \"Test\", \"--json\"], \"create\");\n    logger.trace(\"br output\", json!({\"stdout\": br_result.stdout, \"stderr\": br_result.stderr}));\n    \n    logger.info(\"Executing bd create\");\n    let bd_result = workspace.run_bd([\"create\", \"Test\", \"--json\"], \"create\");\n    logger.trace(\"bd output\", json!({\"stdout\": bd_result.stdout, \"stderr\": bd_result.stderr}));\n    \n    logger.info(\"Comparing outputs\");\n    let comparison = compare_json(\u0026br_result.stdout, \u0026bd_result.stdout, \u0026mode);\n    \n    if let Err(e) = \u0026comparison {\n        logger.error(\"Comparison failed\", json!({\"error\": e}));\n    }\n    \n    logger.summary(TestResult { passed: comparison.is_ok(), ... });\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Enhanced Comparison Modes\n```rust\npub enum CompareMode {\n    // Existing\n    ExactJson,\n    NormalizedJson,\n    ContainsFields(Vec\u003cString\u003e),\n    ExitCodeOnly,\n    \n    // NEW\n    ArrayUnordered,              // Compare arrays ignoring order\n    FieldsExcluded(Vec\u003cString\u003e), // Ignore specified fields\n    StructureOnly,               // Compare JSON structure, not values\n    RegexMatch(String),          // Output matches regex pattern\n    CustomComparator(Box\u003cdyn Fn(\u0026Value, \u0026Value) -\u003e Result\u003c(), String\u003e\u003e),\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

Read blocked issues from `blocked_issues_cache` table (not recalculated on the fly).\n2. For each blocked issue, retrieve immediate blockers (issues with `blocks` dependency).\n3. Apply filters (type, priority, labels).\n4. Sort by priority (ascending), then by number of blockers (descending).\n5. Return up to `--limit` issues.\n\n## Data Model\n```rust\npub struct BlockedIssue {\n    pub issue: Issue,\n    pub blocked_by_count: usize,\n    pub blocked_by: Vec\u003cString\u003e,  // IDs of immediate blockers\n}\n```\n\n## Output\n\n### JSON\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Implement feature\",\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"priority\": 1,\n    \"blocked_by_count\": 2,\n    \"blocked_by\": [\"bd-xyz89\", \"bd-def34\"]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Text Output (default)\n```\nBlocked Issues (3 total):\n\n1.

[bd-ghi56] P2 Add tests\n   Blocked by:\n     • bd-abc12: Implement feature [P1] [blocked]\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n- **DatabaseNotInitialized**: If beads not initialized → suggest `br init`.\n- **CacheInvalid**: If cache is stale, trigger rebuild transparently.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(\"Fetching blocked issues from cache\");\ntracing::debug!(count = blocked.len(), \"Found {}

Resolve both IDs via partial matching.\n2. Validate dependency type (warn on unknown, use `blocks`).\n3. **Exception**: Skip ID validation for `external:\u003cproject\u003e:\u003ccapability\u003e` targets.\n4. Check for cycles (blocking types only, depth limit 100).\n5. Insert dependency record.\n6. Update blocked_issues_cache.\n7. Mark both issues as dirty.\n8. Emit `dependency_added` event.\n\n### dep remove\n1. Resolve IDs.\n2. Delete dependency record.\n3. Update blocked_issues_cache.\n4. Mark both issues as dirty.\n5. Emit `dependency_removed` event.\n\n### dep list\n- `down`: Dependencies this issue has (what it waits on).\n- `up`: Dependents (what waits on this issue).\n- `both`: Both directions.\n- Filter by `--type` if specified.\n\n### dep tree\n1. Build dependency tree from root issue.\n2. Apply `--max-depth` limit (default: 10).\n3. Return **flat list** of `TreeNode` objects with depth and parent info.\n4. Order by depth, then priority, then ID.\n5. Mark truncated nodes if depth limit reached.\n6. External deps synthesize leaf nodes (down direction only).\n\n### dep cycles\n1. Run cycle detection on all blocking dependencies.\n2. Use DFS with path tracking.\n3. Return list of cycles (each cycle is list of issue IDs).\n\n## Output\n\n### dep add/remove - JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"ok\",\n  \"issue_id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n  \"depends_on_id\": \"bd-xyz89\",\n  \"type\": \"blocks\",\n  \"action\": \"added\"\n}\n```\n\n### dep list - JSON\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"depends_on_id\": \"bd-xyz89\",\n    \"type\": \"blocks\",\n    \"title\": \"Database schema\",\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"priority\": 0\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### dep tree - JSON (flat TreeNode list)\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-abc12\",\n    \"title\": \"Root issue\",\n    \"depth\": 0,\n    \"parent_id\": null,\n    \"priority\": 1,\n    \"status\": \"open\",\n    \"truncated\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"bd-xyz89\",\n

JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"cycles\": [\n    [\"bd-abc12\", \"bd-def34\", \"bd-ghi56\", \"bd-abc12\"]\n  ],\n  \"count\": 1\n}\n```\n\n### Text Output - dep tree\n```\nbd-abc12: Root issue [P1] [open]\n├──

**IssueNotFound**: ID does not resolve → error.\n- **DependencyExists**: Adding duplicate → warning (idempotent).\n- **CycleDetected**: Adding would create cycle → error with cycle path.\n- **InvalidDependencyType**: Unknown type → warning, use `blocks`.\n- **SelfDependency**: Issue depends on itself → error.\n\n## Logging\n```rust\ntracing::info!(issue = %issue_id, depends_on = %depends_on_id, \"Adding dependency\");\ntracing::debug!(dep_type = %dep_type, \"Dependency type\");\ntracing::info!(issue = %issue_id, depends_on = %depends_on_id, \"Dependency added\");\ntracing::warn!(dep_type = %dep_type, \"Unknown dependency type, using blocks\");\ntracing::error!(cycle = ?path, \"Cycle detected\");\ntracing::debug!(tree_size = tree.len(), max_depth = depth, \"Built dependency tree\");\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Cycle prevention for blocking types only.\n- Dependency type validation with fallback.\n- Tree output matches bd (flat list semantics, truncated flag).\n- External dep handling (`external:*`).\n- Blocked cache updated on add/remove.\n\n## Unit Tests (storage layer)\n```rust\n//

Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding agents can connect to MCP servers to access external tools, databases, and APIs.\n\n### Why This Matters\n- MCP enables seamless integration with AI coding agents\n- Docker MCP Toolkit provides one-click deployment\n- br as an MCP server would allow agents to query/update issues directly\n- Removes friction between AI agents and issue tracking\n\n## Goals\nImplement br as an MCP server that allows AI coding agents to interact with issues through the standard MCP protocol.\n\n## In-Scope\n- MCP server implementation for br\n- Read operations: list, show, ready, blocked, search\n- Write operations: create, update, close, add comment\n- Resource exposure: issues as MCP resources\n- Tool exposure: br commands as MCP tools\n- Automatic configuration for Claude Code\n\n## Out-of-Scope\n- Complex graph analysis (use bv for that)\n- Real-time notifications (MCP is request/response)\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### MCP Server Implementation\n```rust\n// Using mcp-sdk-rs or similar\nuse mcp_sdk::{Server, Tool, Resource};\n\nstruct BrMcpServer {\n    storage: Storage,\n}\n\nimpl Server for BrMcpServer {\n    fn list_tools(\\u0026self) -\u003e Vec\u003cTool\u003e {\n        vec![\n            Tool::new(\"br_ready\", \"Get issues ready to work on\"),\n            Tool::new(\"br_create\", \"Create a new issue\"),\n            Tool::new(\"br_close\", \"Close an issue\"),\n            // ...\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    fn list_resources(\\u0026self) -\u003e Vec\u003cResource\u003e {\n        vec![\n            Resource::new(\"issues\", \"All issues in the project\"),\n            Resource::new(\"issue/{id}\", \"Single issue by ID\"),\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    fn call_tool(\\u0026self, name: \\u0026str, args: Value) -\u003e Result\u003cValue\u003e {\n        match name {\n            \"br_ready\" =\u003e self.handle_ready(args),\n            \"br_create\" =\u003e self.handle_create(args),\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Transport Options\n- **stdio**: For local process spawning (Claude Code default)\n- **HTTP**: For remote/shared servers\n\n### Auto-Configuration\n```bash\n# Detect Claude Code and configure MCP\nbr mcp setup --auto\n\n# Manual setup\nbr mcp install --scope user\n\n# Test the server\nbr mcp test\n```\n\n### Configuration Output\n```json\n// Adds to ~/.claude.json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"br\": {\n      \"command\": \"br\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\", \"serve\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BEADS_DIR\": \"/path/to/.beads\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `br mcp serve` starts MCP server\n- [ ] All read operations work via MCP\n- [ ] All write operations work via MCP\n- [ ] Auto-configuration for Claude Code works\n- [ ] Server handles concurrent requests\n- [ ] Error responses follow MCP spec\n\n## References\n- MCP Spec: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n- Claude Code MCP docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp\n- Docker MCP Toolkit\n\n## Dependencies\n- Agent Ergonomics epic (for JSON output patterns)\n- Phase 5 completion (stable CLI)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","estimated_minutes":0,"created_at":"2026-01-16T18:52:04.64994921Z","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-16T18:54:39.532827529Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T18:54:39.532827529Z","close_reason":"ERROR: MCP server integration likely overlaps with bv's agent integration features.

This is a read-only view used to catch missing close operations.\n\n## Behavior (classic)\n- Runs `git log --oneline --all` and extracts IDs like `(bd-abc123)`.\n- Prefix is read from DB config `issue_prefix` (fallback default `bd`).\n- Supports hierarchical IDs (e.g., `bd-abc.1`).\n- For each issue ID, keep only the **latest (most recent)** commit reference.\n- Only return issues whose status is `open` or `in_progress`.\n- If not a git repo, missing `.beads/`, or missing DB: return empty list (no error).\n\n## CLI\n```\nbr orphans [--details] [--fix]\n```\n- `--details`: include latest commit hash + message in human output.\n- `--fix`: **interactive** close flow (no JSON batch). Should prompt for confirmation\n  then run `br close \u003cid\u003e --reason Implemented` per issue.\n\n## Output (JSON)\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": \"bd-abc\",\n    \"title\": \"Fix edge-case\",\n    \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n    \"latest_commit\": \"deadbeef\",\n    \"latest_commit_message\": \"Fix edge-case for parser\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Matches commit parsing and latest-commit selection rules.\n- Returns empty list (not error) when git/DB not available.\n- JSON shape matches bd.\n\n## Tests\n- Fixture repo with commits referencing issue IDs; verify latest commit selection.\n- Non-git directory returns empty list with exit 0.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"opus-agent","estimated_minutes":0,"created_at":"2026-01-16T07:04:27.819105411Z","created_by":"Dicklesworthstone","updated_at":"2026-01-17T08:51:51.228489443Z","closed_at":"2026-01-17T08:51:51.228412148Z","close_reason":"orphans command fully implemented: scans git commits for issue IDs, returns open/in_progress issues with latest commit info, supports --details and --fix flags, JSON output matches spec, gracefully handles non-git directories."}

Failure Handling\n\nOn conformance failure, CI must:\n\n1. **Capture full outputs**:\n```bash\n# Save both br and bd outputs\nmkdir -p artifacts/failures/$TEST_NAME\ncp br_output.json artifacts/failures/$TEST_NAME/\ncp bd_output.json artifacts/failures/$TEST_NAME/\n```\n\n2. **Generate visual diff**:\n```rust\nfn generate_diff_html(br: \u0026str, bd: \u0026str) -\u003e String {\n    // Use similar-asserts or custom diff for colored output\n}\n```\n\n3. **Create actionable error**:\n```\n❌ Conformance failure: test_create_with_priority\n\nExpected (bd):\n  {\"title\": \"Test\", \"priority\": 1, \"status\": \"open\"}\n  \nActual (br):\n  {\"title\": \"Test\", \"priority\": 1, \"status\": \"Open\"}  // Note: \"Open\" vs \"open\"\n  \nDifference:\n  - status: \"open\"\n  + status: \"Open\"\n  \nSuggestion: Check src/model/status.rs for case sensitivity in serialization\n```\n\n4. **Archive comprehensive logs**:\n```\nartifacts/\n├── conformance.log          # Full test output\n├── conformance-results.xml  # JUnit XML\n├── failures/\n│   └── test_create_with_priority/\n│       ├── br_output.json\n│       ├── bd_output.json\n│       ├── diff.html\n│       └── test.log\n└── timing/\n    └── performance.csv\n```\n\n### 4. Performance Gate (Optional)\n\n**Regression Detection**:\n```yaml\n- name: Check for Performance Regression\n  run: |\n    NEW_MEDIAN=$(jq '.summary.median_speedup' benchmark-results.json)\n    OLD_MEDIAN=$(jq '.summary.median_speedup' .github/benchmark-baseline.json)\n    \n    REGRESSION=$(echo \"scale=2; ($OLD_MEDIAN - $NEW_MEDIAN) / $OLD_MEDIAN * 100\" | bc)\n    \n    if [ $(echo \"$REGRESSION \u003e 15\" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then\n      echo \"::error::Performance regression detected: ${REGRESSION}%\"\n      exit 1\n    fi\n```\n\n### 5. Detailed Logging Infrastructure\n\n**Log Levels**:\n```rust\npub enum LogLevel {\n    Error,    // Only failures\n    Warn,     // Failures + warnings\n    Info,     // + test progress\n    Debug,    // + command details\n    Trace,    // + raw outputs\n}\n```\n\n**Structured Log Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-17T10:00:00.123Z\",\n  \"level\": \"INFO\",\n  \"test\": \"conformance_create_basic\",\n  \"phase\": \"execute\",\n  \"message\": \"Running br create\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"command\": [\"create\", \"Test issue\", \"--json\"],\n    \"workspace\": \"/tmp/conformance_abc123/br_workspace\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Log Aggregation**:\n```rust\npub struct TestRunSummary {\n    pub total_tests: usize,\n    pub passed: usize,\n    pub failed: usize,\n    pub skipped: usize,\n    pub total_duration: Duration,\n    pub slowest_tests: Vec\u003c(String, Duration)\u003e,\n    pub failures: Vec\u003cTestFailure\u003e,\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n1.

{"id":"second-7nh","title":"EPIC: Installation \u0026 Distribution Automation","description":"# Installation \u0026 Distribution Automation\n\n## Background \u0026 Rationale\n\nBased on research of mature Rust/Go CLI tools (xf, cass, beads_viewer) and 2025-2026 distribution best practices, br needs a professional-grade installation and update system that makes adoption frictionless and secure.\n\n### Why This Matters\n- One-liner installation is the gold standard for CLI tool adoption\n- Users expect tools to auto-update (or easily update) themselves\n- Multi-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows; x86_64, ARM64) is table stakes\n- Security requires checksum verification and signed releases\n- AI coding agents benefit from automated tool management\n\n## Goals\nDeliver a complete distribution system that enables users to install br with a single command, receive automatic updates, and trust the integrity of downloaded binaries.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Multi-Platform Installer Script\n- Platform detection (Linux/macOS/Windows, amd64/arm64)\n- Download from GitHub Releases with checksum verification\n- Fallback to source build if binary unavailable\n- Idempotent installation (safe to re-run)\n- Lock mechanism to prevent concurrent installs\n- Resume capability for interrupted downloads\n- PATH modification with shell detection\n\n### 2. Self-Update Command\n- `br update` - Check for and install updates\n- `br update --check` - Check only, don't install\n- `br update --force` - Force reinstall current version\n- Use `self_update` or `patchify` crate\n- Ed25519 signature verification\n- SHA256 hash verification of downloaded files\n- Streaming downloads for large files\n\n### 3. Release Automation\n- GitHub Actions workflow for multi-platform builds\n- Automatic checksum generation\n- Release asset naming convention\n- Changelog generation from closed issues\n\n### 4. Package Manager Distribution\n- Homebrew tap: `brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/br`\n- Scoop bucket for Windows users\n- AUR package for Arch Linux\n- crates.io publishing for Rust users\n\n### 5.
